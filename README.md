<h1> Are you struggling to study? Here are some tips on how! </h1>
<h2> In this, we will cover 3 different study methods that help me and my friends stay focused </h2>
<p> Studying can be hard, especially if you are not used to focusing for long periods of time. To help fight procrastination, here are 3 ways to study to help you work faster, smarter, and productively. </p>
<h3> <b> 1. 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off </b> </h3>
<p> In this alternating way to study, where you can actually feel like you have a break before you have to go to your next task. 25 minutes is just before the "this feels like I'm working forever point," allowing you not feel overworked in one sitting. With the 5 minute break, this helps serperate tasks so you are not just working back to back. With this method, you have a constant cycle of working, with 2 breaks and 2 study blocks in 1 hour! One of my favorite timers for this is the Pomofocus one, which is easy to set up and you can add multiple "tasks" or blocks of 25 minutes. </p>
