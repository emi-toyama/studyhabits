<h2 style="font-family:verdana"> In this, we will cover 3 different study methods that help me and my friends stay focused </h2>
<ol>
  <li style="font-family:verdana"> 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off </li>
  <li style="font-family:verdana"> Retaking notes </li>
  <li style="font-family:verdana"> Throwing out what you know and relearning what you don't </li>
</ol>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> Studying can be hard, especially if you are not used to focusing for long periods. I know there are days when I am so swamped with work I just sit and stare at my screen, having no idea where to start. To help fight procrastination, here are 3 ways to study to help you work faster, smarter, and productively. </p>
<h3 style="font-family:verdana" style="font-size:30px"> <b> 1. 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off </b> </h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> With this alternating way to study, you can feel like you have a break before you have to go to your next task. 25 minutes is just before the "this feels like I'm working forever point," allowing you not to feel overworked in one sitting. With the 5-minute break, this helps separate tasks so you are not just working back to back. With this method, you have a constant cycle of working, with 2 breaks and 2 study blocks in 1 hour! One of my favorite timers for this is the Pomofocus one, which is easy to set up and you can add multiple "tasks" or blocks of 25 minutes. -> <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">Pomofocus Timer</a></p>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana" style="font-size:30px"> <b> 2. Retaking notes </b> </h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> If you are a visual learner like me, rewriting or retaking your notes can be extemely helpful. When writing something down, it tends to stick in your mind longer. This means that writing down what you already know is a great way to have small details be remembered, especially in classes where most of the material is just memorization rather than application. </p>
<h3 style="font-family:verdana" style="font-size:30px"> <b> 3. Throwing out what you know and relearning what you don't </b> </h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> This is similar to "throwing up" the information you know. To use this study method, you simply just write down everything you remember about a topic onto a piece of paper. After you do this, you can go back into your notes and see the information that you missed. When going back, make sure to mark everything, and relearn it to make sure it stay in your mind. My favorite part about this method is you ca do it multiple time to see how much progress you have made. Comparing your old paper to new ones is also useful to see if you have been improving.
